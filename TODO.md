### Calendar Class
- needs to get data from some `api` endpoint (user defined; config?)
  - need to document this

- need to combine `_switchViewCalendar` with `_switchViewEvent`

- denote the current date (change the color of the text in the day)

### Day class
- needs a way to generate the event icons (create a function for this)
- check to see if callback was passed to constructor, if not, pass noop function


### ViewTypes class
- create class to contain constants rather than just importing a file with variables
- rename file to more appropriate name
